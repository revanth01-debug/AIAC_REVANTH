def calculate_average_ticket_duration(tickets: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the average duration in minutes between ticket 'opened' and 'closed' timestamps.

    This function iterates through a list of tickets, parsing the 'opened' and
    'closed' timestamps for each. It calculates the duration in minutes for each
    valid ticket and then returns the average.

    Args:
        tickets (List[Dict[str, Any]]): A list of dictionaries, where each
            dictionary represents a ticket. Each ticket should contain 'opened'
            and 'closed' keys with ISO 8601 formatted timestamp strings
            (e.g., '2023-10-27T10:00:00').

    Returns:
        int: The average duration in minutes (truncated). Returns 0 if no
             valid tickets with both 'opened' and 'closed' timestamps are found.
